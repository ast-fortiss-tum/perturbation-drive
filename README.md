# PerturbationDrive

A library to test the robustness and ability to generalize to unseen roads of self-driving cars via image perturbations and road generators.

This library has three main modules:

1) A collection of the most common perturbation functions which can be used by itself.
2) A benchmarking controller to benchmark the robustness of models to common image perturbations. This controller can be used for end-to-end tests and offline testing.
3) Modular simulator integration. New simulators can be integrated by implementing a predefined interface and this project shows the example integration of the [Self Driving Sandbox Donkey](https://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/deep_learning/simulator/) (here often referred to as SDSandbox) and [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) Simulator. Note, that the simulators used in this project have been adapted minimally to suit the scope of this project.

## Installation

You can install the library via the instructions detailed in section [Installing locally](#installing-locally).

After installing this library you can use all perturbationdrive classes and functions via top-level imports. See these examples for the usage.

```Python
from perturbationdrive import (
    PerturbationDrive,
    RandomRoadGenerator,
    PerturbationSimulator,
    ADS,
    Scenario,
    ScenarioOutcome,
    ImageCallBack,
    ImagePerturbation,
    GlobalLog as Gl,
)
```

Please note, that all imports from the `examples` directory need to be resolved via their full path.

```Python
from examples.udacity.udacity_simulator import UdacitySimulator
```

## Performing Image Perturbations

Apply common image perturbations and corruptions to images. Note, that each method expects an image with 3 color channels and the dtype `uint8`.
Each perturbation needs an input image and the scale of the perturbation as input. The scale is in the range from 0 to 4.

```Python
from perturbationdrive import poisson_noise
import numpy as np

height, width = 300, 300
random_image = np.random.randint(0, 256, (height, width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
perturbed_image = poisson_noise(0, random_image)
```

Read the README in the `perturbationdrive/` directory for more details on performing standalone image perturbations.

## Benchmarking Self-Driving Cars

The benchmarking is performed by the `PerturbationDrive` class. This class can perform either offline evaluation of a dataset, perform a grid search over the entire search space, or simulate a list of specific scenarios.

A benchmarking object can be created by instantiating a new `PerturbationDrive` object. Each object needs to be constructed with the simulator under test and the system under test. The system under test is an `Autonomous Driving System (ADS)`. Note that this example snippet is minimal and does not provide a full example. For full examples refer to the [Simulator Integration Section](#simulator-integration).

```Python
# setup demo objects
simulator = ExampleSimulator()
ads = ExampleADS()

# create a new perturbation controller
benchmarking_object = PerturbationDrive(simulator=simulator, ads=ads)

# perform grid search as end to end test
benchmarking_object.grid_seach()

# simulate scenarios as end to end test
benchmarking_obj.simulate_scenarios(scenarios=getDemoScenarios())

# perform model based testing on a dataset
benchmarking_obj.offline_perturbation(dataset_path="./dataset/")
```

Read the README in the `perturbationdrive/` directory for more documentation on running end-to-end or model-based tests based on image perturbations.

## Simulator Integration

The simulator provides an easy-to-use interface for running simulations with this library, with or without image perturbations. A simulator integration can be achieved by creating a subclass from the simulator and implementing all class methods. All class methods are depicted in the following class signature.

```Python
class PerturbationSimulator(ABC):
    def __init__(
        self,
        max_xte: float = 2.0,
        simulator_exe_path: str = "",
        host: str = "127.0.0.1",
        port: int = 9091,
        initial_pos: Union[Tuple[float, float, float, float], None] = None,
    ):
        # inits a new simulator object

    @abstractmethod
    def connect(self):
        # connects the class to the simulator binary

    @abstractmethod
    def simulate_scanario(
        self, agent: ADS, scenario: Scenario, perturbation_controller: ImagePerturbation
    ) -> ScenarioOutcome:
        # simulates a scenario

    @abstractmethod
    def tear_down(self):
        # tears down the connection to the simulator binary
```

Read the README in the `perturbationdrive/simulator/` directory for more documentation on simulator integration. Also, have a look at the example integrations in `examples/self_driving_sandbox_donkey/` and `examples/udacity/`.

    micromamba create -n myenv python=3.9
    ```

3. Activate the environment

    ```Shell
    micromamba activate myenv
    ```

4. Install all requirements

    ```Shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ```Shell
    cd PerturbationDrive
    pip install .
    ```

    After local installation, the library can imported via `import perturbationdrive` within any Python script.

6. Deactivate the environment after use

    ```Shell
    micromamba deactivate myenv
    ```

### Troubleshooting

Depending on your setup you might to need to exclude some libraries (i.e. `tensorflow-metal`)
